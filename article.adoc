The upcoming release of Apache CXF 4.1 will establish strong build and runtime compatibility with JVMs running Linux on POWER.  

=== So which JVMs has Apache CXF been curated to work well upon PPC64LE? 

* Adoptium Eclipse Temurin
* IBM Semeru
* RedHat OpenJDK


These are the three distributions which provide PPC64LE support. 

Asoprium Eclipse Temurin and RedHat OpenJDK are both OpenJDK based, with IBM Semuru using OpenJ9.

In our builds towards stable PPC64LE support, Apache CXF 4.1 will ship with its internal performance script.  Using this script we’ve been able to run JAX-RS, and JAX-WS workflows to help stress the JVM, and identify runtime issues.
