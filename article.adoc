== Apache CXF on PPC64LE

The upcoming release of Apache CXF 4.1  will establish strong build and runtime compatibility with JVMs running Linux on POWER.  


=== So which JVMs has Apache CXF been curated to work well upon PPC64LE? 

* Adoptium Eclipse Temurin
* IBM Semeru
* RedHat OpenJDK


These are the three distributions which provide PPC64LE support.  


=== Let’s take a look through the journey towards stable support.
